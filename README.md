# Usage of Design Files

At Oak Development Technologies, we believe in open source hardware and software. To make this happen, we willingly publish the schematic and board files to 
all of our designs. With this in mind, we did take time to make these designs and share them with you and hope that you respect the MIT License we've attached herein to this repository.

Additionally, while we share these designs freely, making them isn't free. Purchasing these boards and designs from our store helps us continue to offer these designs free of charge.

Please help support the open source community and our contributions through sharing our mission with others and where possible, purchasing the hardware we cheerfully build for you
